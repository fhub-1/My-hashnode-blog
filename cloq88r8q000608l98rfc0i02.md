# Learn Next.js: Creating Layouts and Pages | Next.js

5â€“6 minutes

---

So far, your application only has a home page. Let's learn how you can create more routes with **layouts** and **pages**.

In this chapter...

Here are the topics weâ€™ll cover

Create the `dashboard` routes using file-system routing.

Understand the role of folders and files when creating new route segments.

Create a nested layout that can be shared between multiple dashboard pages.

Understand what colocation, partial rendering, and the root layout are.

## [Nested routing](about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnextjs.org%2Flearn%2Fdashboard-app%2Fcreating-layouts-and-pages#nested-routing)

Next.js uses file-system routing where **folders** are used to create nested routes. Each folder represents a **route segment** that maps to a **URL segment**.

![Diagram showing how folders map to URL segments](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Flearn%2Flight%2Ffolders-to-url-segments.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_DMxUNCqwKHv5tB1DKqKC7s3EktHa align="left")

You can create separate UIs for each route using `layout.tsx` and `page.tsx` files.

`page.tsx` is a special Next.js file that exports a React component, and it's required for the route to be accessible. In your application, you already have a page file: `/app/page.tsx` - this is the home page associated with the route `/`.

To create a nested route, you can nest folders inside each other and add `page.tsx` files inside them. For example:

![Diagram showing how adding a folder called dashboard creates a new route '/dashboard'](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Flearn%2Flight%2Fdashboard-route.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_DMxUNCqwKHv5tB1DKqKC7s3EktHa align="left")

`/app/dashboard/page.tsx` is associated with the `/dashboard` path. Let's create the page to see how it works!

## [Creating the dashboard page](about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnextjs.org%2Flearn%2Fdashboard-app%2Fcreating-layouts-and-pages#creating-the-dashboard-page)

Create a new folder called `dashboard` inside `/app`. Then, create a new `page.tsx` file inside the `dashboard` folder with the following content:

```bash
export default function Page() {
  return <p>Dashboard Page</p>;
}
```

Now, make sure that the development server is running and visit [http://localhost:3000/dashboard](http://localhost:3000/dashboard)

. You should see the "Dashboard Page" text.

This is how you can create different pages in Next.js: create a new route segment using a folder, and add a `page` file inside it.

By having a special name for `page` files, Next.js allows you to [colocate](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#colocation) UI components, test files, and other related code with your routes. Only the content inside the `page` file will be publicly accessible. For example, the `/ui` and `/lib` folders are *colocated* inside the `/app` folder along with your routes.

## [Practice: Creating the dashboard pages](about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnextjs.org%2Flearn%2Fdashboard-app%2Fcreating-layouts-and-pages#practice-creating-the-dashboard-pages)

Let's practice creating more routes. In your dashboard, create two more pages:

1. **Customers Page**: The page should be accessible on [http://localhost:3000/dashboard/customers](http://localhost:3000/dashboard/customers)
    

* . For now, it should return a `<p>Customers Page</p>` element.
    
* **Invoices Page**: The invoices page should be accessible on [http://localhost:3000/dashboard/invoices](http://localhost:3000/dashboard/invoices)
    

1. . For now, also return a `<p>Invoices Page</p>` element.
    

Spend some time tackling this exercise, and when you're ready, expand the toggle below for the solution:

## [Creating the dashboard layout](about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnextjs.org%2Flearn%2Fdashboard-app%2Fcreating-layouts-and-pages#creating-the-dashboard-layout)

Dashboards have some sort of navigation that is shared across multiple pages. In Next.js, you can use a special `layout.tsx` file to create UI that is shared between multiple pages. Let's create a layout for the dashboard pages!

Inside the `/dashboard` folder, add a new file called `layout.tsx` and paste the following code:

```bash
import SideNav from '@/app/ui/dashboard/sidenav';
 
export default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <div className="flex h-screen flex-col md:flex-row md:overflow-hidden">
      <div className="w-full flex-none md:w-64">
        <SideNav />
      </div>
      <div className="flex-grow p-6 md:overflow-y-auto md:p-12">{children}</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

A few things are going on in this code, so let's break it down:

First, you're importing the `<SideNav />` component into your layout. Any components you import into this file will be part of the layout.

The `<Layout />` component receives a `children` prop. This child can either be a page or another layout. In your case, the pages inside `/dashboard` will automatically be nested inside a `<Layout />` like so:

![Folder structure with dashboard layout nesting the dashboard pages as children](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Flearn%2Flight%2Fshared-layout.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_DMxUNCqwKHv5tB1DKqKC7s3EktHa align="left")

Check that everything is working correctly by saving your changes and checking your [localhost](http://localhost). You should see the following:

![Dashboard page with a sidenav and a main content area](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Flearn%2Flight%2Fshared-layout-page.png&w=1920&q=75&dpl=dpl_DMxUNCqwKHv5tB1DKqKC7s3EktHa align="left")

One benefit of using layouts in Next.js is that on navigation, only the page components update while the layout won't re-render. This is called [partial rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#3-partial-rendering):

![Folder structure showing the dashboard layout nesting the dashboard pages, but only the pages UI swap on navigation](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Flearn%2Flight%2Fpartial-rendering-dashboard.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_DMxUNCqwKHv5tB1DKqKC7s3EktHa align="left")

## [Root layout](about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnextjs.org%2Flearn%2Fdashboard-app%2Fcreating-layouts-and-pages#root-layout)

In Chapter 3, you imported the `Inter` font into another layout: `/app/layout.tsx`. As a reminder:

```bash
import '@/app/ui/global.css';
import { inter } from '@/app/ui/fonts';
 
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={`${inter.className} antialiased`}>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

This is called a [root layout](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#root-layout-required) and is required. Any UI you add to the root layout will be shared across **all** pages in your application. You can use the root layout to modify your `<html>` and `<body>` tags, and add metadata (you'll learn more about metadata in [a later chapter](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/adding-metadata)).

Since the new layout you've just created (`/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`) is unique to the dashboard pages, you don't need to add any UI to the root layout above.

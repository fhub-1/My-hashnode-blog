## Setting up Tailwind with Styled Components using Twin. macro in ReactJS

ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥In this video, we will be looking at how to set up Tailwind CSS with styled-components using a helper library known as a twin.macro

I really enjoyed setting this library up because you get the best of both worlds. The flexibility in using tailwind classes as well as the extraction of styled-components to keep your code clean without long HTML tags.
